#' Ehler's Correlation Trend Indicator
#'
#' Ehler's Correlation Trend Indicator (CTI) measures the Spearman correlation
#' of the price with the ideal trend line: a straight line with increasing
#' slope.
#'
#' The CTI measures the Spearman correlation between the price and the ideal
#' trend line with slope of \code{slope}, over the past \code{n} days.
#'
#' See URL in references section for further details.
#'
#' @param price Price series that is coercible to xts or matrix.
#' @param n Number of periods to use.
#' @param slope Slope of desired trend.
#' @return A object of the same class as \code{price} or a matrix (if
#' \code{try.xts} fails) with the column:
#'  \describe{
#'   \item{cti}{ The Correlation Trend Indicator. }
#'  }
#' @note Positive/negative CTI values signal positive/negative correlation with
#' the desired trend line slope. A simple strategy could be long when the CTI
#' is positive and, short when it is negative.

#' @seealso See \code{\link{aroon}}, \code{\link{CCI}}, \code{\link{ADX}},
#' \code{\link{VHF}}, \code{\link{GMMA}}, \code{\link{TDI}} for other
#' indicators that measure trend direction/strength.
